\section{Field Theory}
\subsection{Extension Fields}
\begin{definition}
	If $E$ is a field and $F$ is a subfield of $E$, we say that $E$ is an \emph{extension} of $F$, or $E$ is a \emph{field extension}. Notation: $E:F$.
\end{definition}

If $F \subset E$ and $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \ldots \in E$, we let $F(\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \ldots)$ denote the smallest subfield of $E$ that contains $F$ and the elements $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \ldots$. The field $F(\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \ldots)$ is the set of all elements in $E$ that can be obtained from elements of $F$ and $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \ldots$ using the field operations $+$, $-$, $\times$ and $/$.

We say that $F(\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \ldots)$ is ``obtained by adjunction or by adjoining $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \ldots$ to $F$'', or ``the field generated by $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \ldots$ over $F$''.

If $F \subset E$ we may regard $E$ as a vector space over $F$.

\begin{definition}
	An extension $E:F$ is called \emph{finite} if $E$ is a finite dimensional vector space over $F$. If $E:F$ is finite then the \emph{degree} $(E:F)$ of the extension is defined by $(E:F) = \text{dim}_F(E)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[The Tower Law]
	Let $F, B, E$ be fields with $F \subset B \subset E$\footnote{Like a \emph{tower} of fields!} such that $B:F$ and $E:B$ are finite extensions. Then $E:F$ is also a finite extension and $(E:F) = (B:F)(E:B)$.
	\begin{proof}
		Let $\{A_1, \ldots, A_r\}$ be a basis of $E$ as a $B$-space, and let $\{C_1, \ldots, C_s\}$ be a basis of $B$ as an $F$-space.
		
		We claim that $\{C_j A_i\ |\ 1 \leq j \leq s, 1 \leq i \leq r\}$ is a basis of $E$ as an $F$-space.
	\end{proof}
\end{theorem}
